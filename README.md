# WeatherApp

This project is a web application that allows the user to find out the current weather in the city he indicates. It is based on Flask, a Python web development framework.

The user enters the name of the city in the form on the site, after which the request is sent to the server, which processes the request and uses the appropriate API to obtain information about the weather in the specified city.

The received weather data is displayed on the page in a user-friendly format, as a picture with a weather icon and a description of the current conditions.

Thus, the user can easily and quickly get up-to-date information about the weather in the city he needs, which can be useful for planning his day or trip.
